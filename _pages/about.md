I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. My research focuses on intrastate conflict, conflict termination, and institution building post-conflict in an effort to better understand how conflict can be prevented from restarting. My dissertation research focuses on understanding the connection between civil war dynamics and institution building post-conflict in the terms of peace agreements. 

To that end, I'm interested in quantitative, statistical, and causally informed along with text-as-data and other qualitative research methods. I work to apply these methods cross-nationally to understand the dynamics surrounding civil conflict termination and post-conflict institution building where they arise.
